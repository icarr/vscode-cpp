VSCode setup for debugging C++ on M1 Apple Silicon macs

This is a stub for starting a new C++ app in VSCode using clang++, c++17, and CodeLLDB debugger for debugging on M1 Apple Silicon.  

Specifically, I created this stub so I don't have to remember how I setup the tasks.json and launch.json for new app development.
